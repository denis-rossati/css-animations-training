# CSS Animations Training
A repo with my introduction to css animation

## Why are you doing this?

I've always wanted to animate my pages. I never was satisfied in just make a static page, but I never have the time to study it.

By definition, "animate" means "bring to life". And I think it works the same for web pages, so I'm determinated to learn it.

## How can I see what have you maded?

You can install live server extension in your VSCode and open a port with the index.html loaded in it. Most of the animations are pretty basic. But this repo is for studies only, not super projects.
